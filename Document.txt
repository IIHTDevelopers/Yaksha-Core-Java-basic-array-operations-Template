Assessment Tasks for "Arrays and Array Operations" Topic
Task 1: Print Elements of an Array
Problem: Write a program that initializes an array of integers and prints each element of the array.

Example:

Input:

java
Copy code
None
Output:

java
Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
Explanation: The program iterates over the array and prints each element one by one.

Task 2: Find the Length of an Array
Problem: Write a program that initializes an array and prints its length.

Example:

Input:

java
Copy code
None
Output:

java
Copy code
Length of the array: 5
Explanation: The program uses the .length attribute to find and print the length of the array.

Task 3: Find the Maximum Value in an Array
Problem: Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers.

Example:

Input:

java
Copy code
None
Output:

java
Copy code
Maximum Value: 9
Explanation: The program iterates over the array and keeps track of the largest value.

Task 4: Skip a Specific Value in an Array
Problem: Write a program that loops through an array and skips printing a specific value (e.g., the value 7).

Example:

Input:

java
Copy code
None
Output:

java
Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
6
8
9
10
Explanation: The program skips printing the value 7 during the loop.

Task 5: Sum of Elements in an Array
Problem: Write a program that sums all the elements of an integer array and prints the result.

Example:

Input:

java
Copy code
None
Output:

java
Copy code
Sum of the array elements: 30
Explanation: The program calculates the sum by iterating through the array and adding each element to a running total.
